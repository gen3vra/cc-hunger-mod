# CrossCode Hunger Mod
Experimental and silly, but working. This mod adds a hunger system to CrossCode. You can eat any kind of food to restore your hunger, and if you don't eat, you will eventually start to lose health and die. The idea behind it would be to encourage consumption of lesser used food items and add another layer of challenge to the game.
